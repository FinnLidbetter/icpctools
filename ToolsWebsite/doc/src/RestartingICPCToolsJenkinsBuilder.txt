From Troy, 6/11/15, on restarting Jenkins Building of ICPCTools:
(updated 4/24/16 per Troy's email)

Visit  http://pc2.ecs.csus.edu:8070/jenkins/ 
(this requires either being on the ECS network, or VPN'd into it).

Once you've logged into Jenkins, click on the project (in this case ICPC)
In the build history you'll see the current run, likely in red if it's been
running a long while.  

Click the red x beside a build to kill it.
(You should probably give an individual build 30 minutes before killing it.)

Once it's killed select "build now" from the list.
