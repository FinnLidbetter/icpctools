Welcome to the ICPC Tools!

The ICPC Tools are a set of tools to support running programming contests. These tools were built to support the
International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) World Finals and have been used there for many years, but
the intention is that they are usable for local and regional contests as well. For more information on the ICPC,
please go to https://icpc.baylor.edu.

Each of the ICPC tools can be used individually, or they can be used as a group. They are all designed to support
the REST-based Contest API as defined by the Competitive Learning Initiative (https://clics.ecs.baylor.edu).
