Upating the ICPCTools webpage at Baylor:

NOTE: this file was written by John, to document the procedure used by John, on John's machine.
It contains John's-machine-specific stuff.  The objective here was to at least provide others with some information, 
which they can hopefully vary to suit their own environment, rather than leave the current void wherein there's NO 
documentation for this procedure other than what's in someone's head...
Please don't complain to John about his posting information
with machine-specific stuff in it, unless you are willing to write a new version that's generic across all developer's
machine environments.  

This file describes the MANUAL process which was initially used to update the ICPCTools website.
Currently the Jenkins "build" process supports automated publication (update of the website), so this process
should not be used unless for some reason Jenkins is not doing the updates.

- Start WinSCP.  It should start up with the following already set:
  - hostname: icpc.baylor.edu
  - user name: icpctoolssftp
  - Advanced->SSH->Authentication->Private Key File:  set to "C:\clevengr\contest\ICPCTools\Website\icpctools.puttyPrivateKey.ppk"
- Enter passphrase ...

-In left panel, navigate to C:\clevengr\contest\icpctools\website

-In right panel, navigate to (double-click on) "webhome".  "Webhome" is the folder which is actually served to the public;
anything placed in "webhome" will be visible publicly.

-To update the main ICPCTools page:
  - edit it in Eclipse
  - check it into git
  - COPY the landingPage.html file (and any new files) to the left-hand WinSCP panel.  BE SURE to HOLD DOWN "CTRL" when
     doing a drag/drop to the WinSCP panel; otherwise since the landingPage.html original (in the Git repo folder) and
     the target folder (the WinSCP left panel) are on the same drive, it will MOVE the files instead of copying them.
  - Copy the landingPage.html file (and any new files) from the left to the right WinSCP panel
     (make sure the right panel is in "webhome")
  - RENAME the current (old) index.html file in the right WinSCP panel to "index.xxxx"  where xxxx is the date
  - Rename the landingPage.html file to "index.html".
