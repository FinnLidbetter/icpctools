Welcome to the ICPC Tools!
==========================

The ICPC Tools are a set of tools to support running programming contests. These tools were built to support the
International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) World Finals and have been used there for many years, but
the intention is that they are usable for local and regional contests as well. For more information on the ICPC,
please go to https://icpc.baylor.edu.

Each of the ICPC tools can be used individually, or they can be used as a group. They are all designed to support
the REST-based Contest API as defined by the Competitive Learning Initiative (CLI): https://clics.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php/Contest_API.

## Contributing

The ICPC Tools are developed, tested, and maintained by a group of ICPC volunteers. Bug reports and knowing
what worked or didn't for your contest are always appreciated.

To become a committer you must have a history of high quality bug reports, PRs, and be approved by Tim,
John Clevenger, and Jeff Donahoo.


## License

All of the tools are provided under the included MIT license and are "Free as in Beer". We welcome you to use
and enjoy them, but if you ever run into anyone who has contributed to them - Tim, John, Sam, Troy, Nicky, etc.
we would greatly appreciate it if you'd buy us a beer, a stroopwafel, or some other suitable token!

we find these tools to be very useful in supporting a variety of common programming contest operations, and we
think you will too; but we do not guarantee that they will do exactly what you want for your programming contest.
