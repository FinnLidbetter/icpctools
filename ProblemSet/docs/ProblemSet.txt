== Using the Editor

=== Installation

To install the editor, download and unzip the distribution package 
from the https://icpc.baylor.edu/icpctools/[ICPCTools website] to any 
convenient location. The editor is a self-contained Java application and
only requires a Java 1.8 JDK to run.

=== Execution

The distribution includes two scripts which can be used to launch the program:
problemSet.bat (for Windows) and problemSet.sh (for MacOS and Linux).
To start the editor, open a terminal window (command shell), 
change to the folder where you unzipped the distribution, and type the name of the
appropriate script. The scripts take one optional parameter: the name or path of
a problemset.yaml to edit.  Executing the script with a single parameter "--help"
will produce a help (usage) message.
